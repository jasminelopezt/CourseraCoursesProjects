Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table =  10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 1000, 8090, 9581
vi. Checkin = 10,000
vii. Photo = 10,000, 6493
viii. Tip = 3979, 537
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	NO NULL VALUES
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(* ) from User
		where id is NULL OR
			  name is NULL OR
			  review_count IS NULL OR
			  yelping_since IS NULL OR
			  useful IS NULL OR 
			  funny IS NULL OR 
			  cool IS NULL OR 
			  fans IS NULL OR 
			  average_stars IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_hot IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_more IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_profile IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_cute IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_list IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_note IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_plain IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_cool IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_funny IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_writer IS NULL OR 
			  compliment_photos IS NULL

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg:0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg:24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT city,sum(review_count) as reviews 
		FROM business

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
they have different distribution hours, longer ones.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         YES. there are different reviews
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No. 
SQL code used for analysis:


		SELECT B.name ,
              	       C.category,
		       B.city, 
		       B.postal_code as zipcode
		       hours , 
		       CASE
			   WHEN stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			   WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
		      END AS rating,
		Inner join hours H  on B.id = H.business_id
		Inner join category C on C.business_id = B.id
		Where city = 'Phoenix' and category = 'Restaurants' and rating in ('2-3 stars','4-5 stars')
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
         Average reviews are higher for those that are open and stars as well.
ii. Difference 2:
         there are more open businesses than closed.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT count(distinct id), 
			   count(distinct city),
			   avg(stars), 
               		   avg(review_count),
			   is_open
		From business
	group By is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         I want to be able to figure out the top 3 businesses that have most stars.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  I will need the name of business, and stars. I will put in descending order as well.
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         The top three are eazor's auto salon, skinrn, and fragance shop.
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
+------------------------+--------------------+-------+
| id                     | name               | stars |
+------------------------+--------------------+-------+
| --cgVkbWTiga3OYTkymKqA | Eazor's Auto Salon |   5.0 |
| --lpHMVmkCuji0ZrpHtXEA | SkinRN             |   5.0 |
| --sdH6tFAdEs7j4Msr7nPA | The Fragrance Shop |   5.0 |
